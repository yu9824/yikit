        Improved Python implementation of the Boruta R package.
        The improvements of this implementation include:
        - Faster run times:
            Thanks to scikit-learn's fast implementation of the ensemble methods.
        - Scikit-learn like interface:
            Use BorutaPy just like any other scikit learner: fit, fit_transform and
            transform are all implemented in a similar fashion.
        - Modularity:
            Any ensemble method could be used: random forest, extra trees
            classifier, even gradient boosted trees.
        - Two step correction:
            The original Boruta code corrects for multiple testing in an overly
            conservative way. In this implementation, the Benjamini Hochberg FDR is
            used to correct in each iteration across active features. This means
            only those features are included in the correction which are still in
            the selection process. Following this, each that passed goes through a
            regular Bonferroni correction to check for the repeated testing over
            the iterations.
        - Percentile:
            Instead of using the max values of the shadow features the user can
            specify which percentile to use. This gives a finer control over this
            crucial parameter. For more info, please read about the perc parameter.
        - Automatic tree number:
            Setting the n_estimator to 'auto' will calculate the number of trees
            in each itartion based on the number of features under investigation.
            This way more trees are used when the training data has many feautres
            and less when most of the features have been rejected.
        - Ranking of features:
            After fitting BorutaPy it provides the user with ranking of features.
            Confirmed ones are 1, Tentatives are 2, and the rejected are ranked
            starting from 3, based on their feautre importance history through
            the iterations.
        We highly recommend using pruned trees with a depth between 3-7.
        For more, see the docs of these functions, and the examples below.
        Original code and method by: Miron B Kursa, https://m2.icm.edu.pl/boruta/
        Boruta is an all relevant feature selection method, while most other are
        minimal optimal; this means it tries to find all features carrying
        information usable for prediction, rather than finding a possibly compact
        subset of features on which some classifier has a minimal error.
        Why bother with all relevant feature selection?
        When you try to understand the phenomenon that made your data, you should
        care about all factors that contribute to it, not just the bluntest signs
        of it in context of your methodology (yes, minimal optimal set of features
        by definition depends on your classifier choice).
        Parameters
        ----------
        estimator : object
            A supervised learning estimator, with a 'fit' method that returns the
            feature_importances_ attribute. Important features must correspond to
            high absolute values in the feature_importances_.
        n_estimators : int or string, default = 1000
            If int sets the number of estimators in the chosen ensemble method.
            If 'auto' this is determined automatically based on the size of the
            dataset. The other parameters of the used estimators need to be set
            with initialisation.
        perc : int | 'auto', default = 'auto'
            Instead of the max we use the percentile defined by the user, to pick
            our threshold for comparison between shadow and real features. The max
            tend to be too stringent. This provides a finer control over this. The
            lower perc is the more false positives will be picked as relevant but
            also the less relevant features will be left out. The usual trade-off.
            The default is essentially the vanilla Boruta corresponding to the max.
        alpha : float, default = 0.05
            Level at which the corrected p-values will get rejected in both
            correction steps.
        two_step : Boolean, default = True
            If you want to use the original implementation of Boruta with Bonferroni
            correction only set this to False.
        max_iter : int, default = 100
            The number of maximum iterations to perform.
        random_state : int, RandomState instance or None; default=None
            If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
            If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
            If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
            by `np.random`.
        verbose : int, default=1
            Controls verbosity of output:
            - 0: no output
            - 1: displays iteration number | if tqdm package exists, progress bar
            - 2: which features have been selected already
        max_shuf : int, default=10000
            How many times to calculate the Pearson coefficient when `perc` is 'auto'.
        n_jobs : int, default=None
            The number of jobs to run in parallel for both `fit` and `predict`.
            If -1, then the number of jobs is set to the number of cores.


        Attributes
        ----------
        n_features_ : int
            The number of selected features.
        support_ : array of shape [n_features]
            The mask of selected features - only confirmed ones are True.
        support_weak_ : array of shape [n_features]
            The mask of selected tentative features, which haven't gained enough
            support during the max_iter number of iterations..
        ranking_ : array of shape [n_features]
            The feature ranking, such that ``ranking_[i]`` corresponds to the
            ranking position of the i-th feature. Selected (i.e., estimated
            best) features are assigned rank 1 and tentative features are assigned
            rank 2.
        importance_history_ : array-like, shape [n_features, n_iters]
            The calculated importance values for each feature across all iterations.

        feat_selector = BorutaPy(rf, n_estimators='auto', verbose=2, random_state=1)

        feat_selector.fit(X, y)
